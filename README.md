# Solidity Programming Essentials
This is the code repository for [Solidity Programming Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/solidity-programming-essentials?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788831383), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
We begin with a brief run-through of blockchain, Ethereum, and their most important concepts or components. You will learn how to install all the necessary tools to write, test, and debug Solidity contracts on Ethereum. Then, you will explore the layout of a Solidity source file and work with the different data types. The next set of recipes will help you work with operators, control structures, and data structures while building your smart contracts. We take you through function calls, return types, function modifers, and recipes in object-oriented programming with Solidity. Learn all you can on event logging and exception handling, as well as testing and debugging smart contracts.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 2 does not have code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.17;
contract First {
        int public mydata;
        function GetDouble(int _data) public returns (int _output) {
                   mydata = _data * 2;
                   return _data * 2;
         }
    }
```

This book assumes a basic level knowledge of programming. It is ideal to have some background on any scripting language. All you need is an internet connectivity and a browser for using a majority of this book. There are sections that will need creating a machine to deploy blockchain specific tools and utilities. This machine can be physical or virtual, on cloud or on-premise.
